The 6,000 ft Bagnall Centre specialises in facilitating lifestyle change. We practice and teach natural healthcare to both the public and health professionals, aiming to support conventional healthcare by improving public health and wellbeing.

We offer high quality low impact fitness and exercise (including yoga, pilates and tai chi), relaxation practices such as mindfulness and meditation, a wide range of complementary therapies, nutritional therapy and healthy cookery classes.  

Complementary therapies practiced at The Bagnall Centre include acupuncture, Amatsu, Bowen, chiropractic, cranio sacral therapy, herbalism, homeopathy, massage, NLP, reflexology and reiki.  We also offer conventional therapies such as counselling, hypnotherapy, osteopathy, physiotherapy and speech and language therapy.
