Come to a FREE Beginners Pilates taster session at Helena's new Monday morning class starting 10am-11am, 4th June! 

Here's what Helena has to say about her classes.

'Do you suffer from a stiff neck or niggling back pain? Are you tired and frustrated of your pain getting in the way of doing the things you love?

 I have been there…There were days when I just wanted to pull the duvet over my head and stay in bed. I knew I couldn’t go on like that forever…

I had x-rays, visited chiropractors, massage therapists… There wasn’t a magic cure, but with their help and regular movement and strengthening I got my life back!

 Pilates is now part of my regular routine and I also devote my time to helping others get out of pain through movement.

I love seeing people get their lives back! Enjoying a meal out again, picking up their child or grandchild, taking part in their favourite sport...

I am so proud of each and every person in my classes for putting the work in and making it happen! 

If this sounds like something that is of interest to you, then I am inviting you to a F-R-E-E Beginners Pilates taster session in my new Monday morning 10-11am at the Bagnall Centre (classes start Monday 4th of June).'
