As women, Christmas is a particularly taxing time for our hormones and our waistlines: stress; people pleasing; rich food; alcohol; lack of sleep; more food... but it doesn't have to equal disaster for our health.

Join registered Nutritional Therapist and women's health expert Kat Smith for this event which will give you the tools to take control of your health and happiness over the festive season. You will also receive Kat's ebook on the topic, as well as a bag of holistic goodies to try.

Sunday 2nd December 10.30am-12pm in the Studio

Â£15
