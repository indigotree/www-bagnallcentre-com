## What’s Your  Best  Thing  Today?

Our monthly LIFE  CLUBs start by asking this question which sets the positive, solution-focused approach.  Life Clubs workshops use fun,  highly interactive and structured materials to get the right/left brains firing together to produce answers to questions such as:-      

* How can I be more in control?
* What can I do to make my life more exciting?
* How can I improve my relationships with family and friends?
* Why do I let my lack of confidence hold me back?
* Is there a way to make my working life less stressful?
* What do I really want out of life and career?
* Where do I want my life to be in five/ten years?

Using the LIFE CLUBS unique ‘buddy system’ participants act as guru and pupil at the same time - we identify and celebrate our achievements and share our learning. 

Answers and solutions pop-up spontaneously from our inner knowledge and experience filtered through our own creative minds producing our signature ‘Lifebulb Moments’!

We set goals and actions which take Clubbers nearer to the life they want.

So if you want to get more out of life, be in control, turn your life around, come along once a month and learn to Laugh More, Love More, Play More and Earn More!
