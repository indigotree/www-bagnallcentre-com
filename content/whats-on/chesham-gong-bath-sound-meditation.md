This is a group for like minded people to experience the sacred sounds of the gong and other complementary instruments within the setting of a gong bath/sound meditation. During the session you are bathed in the powerful sound waves created by the gongs, enabling the body and mind to relax and release any stress and tension. All you have to do is lie down and relax. 

Due to space limitations RSVP for all events is required, we often run a waiting list for people wishing to attend, and would kindly ask that you keep your RSVP up to date if your plans change, this is greatly appreciated, thank you!

If you are in your first trimester of pregnancy or have a health condition that and would like to check if a gong bath is appropriate for you, please do get in touch so we can have a chat.

12.45-1.45pm Saturday 17 Nov.
