You are invited to join us for this unique event celebrating the Autumn Equinox which falls on Sunday 23 September 2018 (also typically known as the Pagan festival of Mabon which is celebrated at the time of the Autumn Equinox between the 21st and 24th of September).

The Autumn Equinox signifies a time of transitioning from Summer into the darker part of the year. At this time the sun remains perfectly balanced between light and dark, before the days become shorter and the nights longer. There is never dark without the light, the balance is always there, whether we are aware of it or not.

As the days grow shorter, you may find yourself tuning into yourself, going inward, and listening to your own inner voice. You could feel the need to slow down a little bit, to appreciate the moments outdoors while you still can, and to spend time in quiet reflection while you watch the seasons change.

It is also the perfect time to recognise, and enjoy our successes while we now ‘harvest’ the fruits of our projects and creative endeavours. If you are feeling that you haven’t achieved much on the material level acknowledge how much you have grown as a person and see this as an equally important success. It is a time for deep reflection and gratitude.

The element associated with Autumn is Water. Water is a feminine element, it is also the element of emotion and subconscious, of purification, intuition, mysteries of the self, compassion and family. Sedna is known as the Inuit Goddess of the Sea and embodies the element of Water.

About the event:

The session will run from 7:30pm-9:30pm (doors will open at 7:15pm).

We will enjoy a 90 minute sound immersion together, with an opening ceremony using alchemical oils and other tools for transformation and self-reflection.

After the sound immersion, we will gather together to hear about the story of Sedna, the inspiration for our healing sounds album, which is a co-creation between Sam & Kirsty using gong, sacred instruments and the natural healing power of the voice. We will also enjoy some delicious handmade conscious chocolate, nibbles and locally sourced herbal tea together.

Exchange for this event is £25 per person, and included in the ticket price is your own personal copy of the Album to take away with you. We will also have additional CDs available on the night should you wish to buy one as a gift for a loved one.

Due to the nature of the session we regret that we are unable to admit late entry, doors open at 7:15pm, to allow plenty of time to arrive and get settled in.
