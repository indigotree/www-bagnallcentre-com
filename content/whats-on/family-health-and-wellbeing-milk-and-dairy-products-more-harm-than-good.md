Respected wellbeing expert Brian Isbell, an experienced natural health practitioner and educator, is holding regular Bagnall Centre Family Health and Wellbeing talks on Monday mornings. 

The talks are open to our customers and complementary health professionals who wish to broaden and deepen their knowledge of self-care and integrated healthcare. These talks will help you and your family understand and implement simple and effective health and wellbeing practices.

Our next talk will focus on Dowsing and will include a practical session. 

The topics included are: 

* What is dowsing?
* What equipment is used?
* How is it carried out?
* What preparation is needed?
* How to use rods.
* Number, map and water dowsing. 
* Research evidence and the medical opinion of dowsing.


The slightly shorter talk will be followed by an opportunity to use a pendulum and dowsing rods.

**10am-12pm, Monday 10th December.**

**Price: Â£10 including refreshments (please book in advance to avoid disappointment!).** 

To book your place, please email <mailto:bookings@bagnallcentre.com> or call [01494 791288](tel:01494791288). 

For the benefit of complementary health practitioners, the talks qualify for Continuing Professional Development points and Brian will provide CPD certificates if required.

**Your Lifestyle. Your Health. Your Choices.**
