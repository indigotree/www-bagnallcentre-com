We are delighted that Teen Yoga is coming to the Bagnall Centre! 

This is a flow yoga class, introducing teens to a real adult style yoga class. Here teenagers will practice pose sequences designed to help them to discover greater strength, flexibility and comfort in their bodies, learn specific breathing techniques to relieve stress and anxiety, improve their balance, coordination and concentration.

Each class will conclude with a brief guided relaxation, giving teens techniques they can use in daily life to find a sense of calm and well-being whenever they need it.

"Look and feel better in body and mind."

No previous yoga experience necessary. Suitable for Y8 children and older.

Wednesdays 6-7pm (Term Time Only)

Classes are Â£8 and block booking is essential as spaces are limited. FIRST CLASS FREE!
