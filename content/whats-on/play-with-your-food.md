This class will allow kids to experiment with a wide range of food with different tastes, textures and appearances, and show them how to create their own healthy recipes to suit their own tastes. All the food will be gluten, dairy and nut free. 

We want kids to be open to more than just familiar and homogenous foods, and to enjoy introducing healthy variety into their diets.

Your child will learn;

1. To be open to trying new and different foods, particularly different flavours, or foods that look different to those that they are used to.

2. Healthy, easy recipes that they can personalise, to encourage a more varied diet.

3. To experiment with different seasonings, additions or substitutions to existing recipes, to encourage creativity with food. 

Places in the Bagnall Centre teaching kitchen are limited, so please do book as soon as possible.

Saturday 9th June 10am-1pm

Cost Â£15. 

The class will be run by Cook for Life (Zoe Hill and Katie Firth), and is sponsored by Bucks County Council and L.I.F.E., a new charitable venture at The Bagnall Centre, to provide subsidised, accessible and healthy cookery classes. 

Zoe is currently studying to be a Natural Chef at the College of Naturopathic Medicine, and Katie is a passionate home cook who has been providing delicious meals to her family and friends for many years.
