Tai chi, also called tai chi chuan, combines deep breathing and relaxation with flowing movements.

Originally developed as a martial art in 13th-century China, tai chi is today practised around the world as a health-promoting exercise. 

Our brand new class is an opportunity to learn and experience the benefits of this ancient Chinese Martial Art, for health, relaxation, self defence and wellbeing.

A soft internal art that develops internal strength while remaining soft and yielding with relaxation yet powerful with flowing movement, it is often referred to as "meditation in movement".
