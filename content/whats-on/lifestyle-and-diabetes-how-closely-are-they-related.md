We are excited to announce our next conference which aims to:

* raise awareness of the importance of lifestyle in diabetes prevention, management and reversal;
* demonstrate why an increasing number of medical professionals now recognise that a healthy lifestyle is a universally available and powerful anti-diabetes intervention;
* build awareness and understanding of the relationship between lifestyle and diabetes and how to reduce your risk.

Diabetes is one of the fastest growing threats to the health of the modern human. It is estimated that over 4 million people, or at least 1 in 16 people in the UK are potentially unknowingly living with, or in severe danger of developing, Type 2 diabetes. In fact, almost half of those affected are believed to be unaware of their condition! Type 1 diabetes affects 400,000 people in the UK.

With all of the complications that this life-changing condition can lead to; from nerve and ocular damage to potentially seizures and even death, it is more vital than ever for us to be aware of our own culpability in the prevalence of this growing epidemic.
