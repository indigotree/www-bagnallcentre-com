* Worrying about keeping you and your family healthy?
* Concerned about high blood sugar? 
* Recently diagnosed with diabetes? 

Diabetes is one of the fastest growing threats to the health of the modern human. It is estimated that over 4 million people, or at least 1 in 16 people in the UK are potentially unknowingly living with, or in severe danger of developing, Type 2 diabetes. In fact, almost half of those affected are believed to be unaware of their condition! Type 1 diabetes affects 400,000 people in the UK.

With all of the complications that this life-changing condition can lead to; from nerve and ocular damage to potentially seizures and even death, it is more vital than ever for us to be aware of our own culpability in the prevalence of this growing epidemic.

With the rising diabetes crisis affecting adults and children alike, do you struggle to balance a healthful home, while navigating time constraints, complex messages and information overload?
