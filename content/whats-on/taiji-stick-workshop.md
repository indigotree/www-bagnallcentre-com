(Tai Ji Yang Sheng Zhang)

In China’s traditional health culture, it has long been a practice to exercise with an instrument like a stick. Excavated from the Mawangdui Tomb, Han Dynasty (206BC - AD220) are illustrations of figures yielding sticks.

All the movements are soft and slow, easy to practise and embody the concept of harmony between yin and yang. 

Key points are:

“The stick guides coordination of body and spirit”

“The waist functions as a pivot to harmonise the body and the stick” 

“Relationship of stick movement and massage”

“Rotation of the stick”

“Hands and stick are integrated as one”

**Taiji Stick Workshops are running on Sunday 14th October and Sunday 9th December from 10am-1pm.**

**Training sticks will be provided - cost of each workshop is £30 (£60 total)**
