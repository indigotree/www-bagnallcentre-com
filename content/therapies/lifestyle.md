It’s important to identify what lifestyle changes we feel will make us happiest, and these don’t need to involve a full-scale transformation. 

Small, simple changes are more sustainable and can help you to feel positive about yourself. 

Why not take some time to reflect on what changes you feel would make a positive difference in your life? At the Bagnall Centre, we have therapists who can help you make positive lifestyle changes. 

Try focusing on one area that is important to you to begin with and consider what simple, sustainable changes you would like to make – and who knows where these changes could lead you!

Your Lifestyle. Your Health. Your Choices.
