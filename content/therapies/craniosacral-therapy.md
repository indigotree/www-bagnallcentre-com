Craniosacral Therapy is a gentle way of working with the body using light touch. People sometimes ask about the name Craniosacral Therapy and think it only refers to the head. In fact Craniosacral  Therapy works with the whole person and changes may occur in body, mind and spirit during and after sessions. When a Craniosacral therapist places her hands lightly on you, she is using them to listen to you in much the same way that a counsellor might listen to your words. Your body responds to this sensitive touch by beginning to listen to itself.

People may come for Craniosacral Therapy because they have acute physical problems like headaches or bad backs, or long-standing problems both physical and emotional. Others come for ongoing support in their busy lives and for help to meet life's challenges. Because it is so gentle and non-invasive its suitable for everyone from newborns to the elderly.

Craniosacral Therapy supports your body's innate ability to balance, restore and heal itself, as well as helping to reduce stress and build your underlying energy.
