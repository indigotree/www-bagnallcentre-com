We are delighted that we have permission to recreate some of the nutrition guidelines from Michael Pollan's book _Food Rules An Eater's Manual_, 2009, Penguin. 

To start this series we thought it appropriate to cite perhaps one of his most famous lines from his earlier book (Pollan, M., In Defense of Food, 2008, Penguin) in which he condenses the answer to what we should eat into just 7 words. 

This is also one of The Bagnall Centre's favourite pieces of nutritional advice! 

**Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.**
