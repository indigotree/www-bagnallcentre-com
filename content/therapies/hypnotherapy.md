Hypnotherapy utilises hypnosis, a state of altered consciousness in which the therapist can help you to access the deeper levels of awareness, to which you are usually oblivious in your normal day-to-day functioning.

More often than not, what you are experiencing as a problem, whether emotional, psychological or psychosomatic (i.e. actually producing physical symptoms) is only a surface effect of a deeper underlying mental/emotional cause. It is at these deeper levels of consciousness that we as hypnotherapists work with you, to bring about change in the way you feel, think and behave. A skilled hypnotherapist will always work with your co-operation and in the most caring and nurturing manner.
