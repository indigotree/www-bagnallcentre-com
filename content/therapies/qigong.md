Qigong covers movement and hands on bodywork - Tai Chi (sometimes described as moving meditation) is a branch of Qigong and Tui Na (therapeutic massage and bodywork) is often used in conjunction with Qigong. 

Qigong is a mind-body-spirit practice to improve mental and physical health by integrating posture, movement, breathing technique, self-massage, sound, and focused intent. Qigong can open the flow of energy in meridians used in acupuncture and Chinese medicine (reference: [National Qi Gong Association](https://www.nqa.org/what-is-qigong-)).
