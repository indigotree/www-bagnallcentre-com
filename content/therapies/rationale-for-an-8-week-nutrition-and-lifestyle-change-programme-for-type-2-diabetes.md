# Type 2 Diabetes

According to NHS England there are 3.4 million people living with type 2 diabetes in the UK, with around 200,000 new diagnoses each year. Not only is type 2 diabetes currently estimated to cost the NHS around £8.8 billion a year, but there is also a significant personal cost to those individuals living with this disease, which if not controlled can lead to numerous complications and have a significant impact on quality of life.

Type 2 diabetes is generally regarded as being a chronic, progressive disease which over time leads to irreversible beta cell failure, with some patients eventually requiring long   term medication. Whilst some individuals appear to be genetically at greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes, diet and lifestyle are understood to play a significant role in its development., ,    

There is now a growing body of evidence to suggest that it may be possible to “reverse” or put type 2 diabetes into “remission” (where individuals with type 2 diabetes are able to get their HbA1c below 42 mmol/mol), through a combination of diet and lifestyle changes which support weight loss and improve the function of insulin in the body. 

## Type 2 Diabetes and Diet

Results from several studies have shown that calorie and carbohydrate restricted diets can reliably reduce high blood glucose in diabetics, potentially reducing the need for medication and in some individuals may even reverse both insulin resistance and beta cell failure.,  Such programmes support relatively rapid weight loss, which until recently was thought to be linked to a higher occurrence of weight regain. However, some recent evidence suggests that rapid weight loss may be associated with better adherence to nutritional programmes, a greater chance of achieving weight loss goals and suggest there is in fact no association with poorer weight maintenance in the longer term.   

## Type 2 Diabetes and Key Lifestyle Factors

Lifestyle factors including activity levels, sleep and stress management all appear to have a significant impact on both current health and future health risks and may all play a key role in the development and subsequent management of type 2 diabetes. For example:

* It is well established that regular physical activity can improve insulin sensitivity and blood glucose control, with modest physical activity being found to be associated with a 58% reduction in risk of type 2 diabetes in high risk populations.
* Epidemiological data indicates a relationship between sleep duration, obesity and HBA1c levels in type 2 diabetes which may be driven by the association between lack of sleep and lower circulating levels of the satiety hormone leptin, coupled with increased levels of the appetite-stimulating hormone ghrelin. Combined, these may encourage increased energy intake, potentially leading to obesity and elevated blood glucose, both of which are precursors to type 2 diabetes. 
* Psychological stress is known to have a negative impact on blood sugar management, with some researchers hypothesising that mind-body therapies may have a positive impact on type 2 diabetes, through down-regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis.

## Supporting Adherence to a Diet and Lifestyle Programme

One of the challenges associated with any diet and lifestyle change programme is sticking to the changes longer term. According to the World Health Organisation up to 50% of patients suffering from chronic diseases fail to adhere to both prescribed medications and diet and lifestyle recommendations, resulting in poorer health outcomes and increased healthcare costs. Two key areas where healthcare practitioners may be able to have a positive influence on patient adherence are through a combination of health education and coaching.  Coaching offers individuals a simple yet effective structure to move forward in significant areas of their lives such as their achieving work/life balance, personal growth and of course health.

## Our 8-Week Diet and Lifestyle Change Programme

Nutritional therapist and health coach Holly Miles, in conjunction with the Bagnall Centre for Integrated Healthcare, has developed an 8-week diet and lifestyle change programme which aims to address key diet and lifestyle factors associated with type 2 diabetes. The programme includes a personalised diet, advice on sleep, activity levels and stress management and regular coaching sessions which provide structure and accountability, on-going advice and education, strategies for overcoming any barriers to change and regular monitoring to help keep participants on track.
