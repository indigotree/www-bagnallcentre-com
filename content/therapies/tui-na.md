Tui Na is an ancient therapy incorporating the principles of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), therapeutic massage and bodywork. It is usually practiced to treat specific problems and restore balance to the body by improving the body's natural healing process. 

Tui Na (meaning literally 'pinch and pull') is a manipulative therapy and can vary in style from vigorous to gentle and subtle. It is often used together with acupuncture and Chinese herbalism.
