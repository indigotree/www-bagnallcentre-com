Counselling provides a regular time and space for people to talk about their troubles and explore difficult feelings in an environment that is dependable, free from intrusion and confidential.   Practitioners help you to gain insight into your feelings and behaviour and can help implement change if necessary.  Counselling can help deal with difficult experiences such as a relationship breakdown, bereavement or redundancy. Or you may want help dealing with feelings of sadness, depression, anxiety or low self-worth that don't seem to be connected to any particular event. Counsellors at the centre practice a range of approaches including phsycho dynamic, cognitive behavioural therapy and humanistic therapy.
