## About the Programme

An 8-week diet and lifestyle change programme run by BANT and CNHC registered nutritional therapist and health coach Holly Miles, in conjunction with the Bagnall Centre for Integrated Healthcare. This programme has been developed to support healthy weight loss, improve overall health and wellness and help improve blood sugar control. 

Holly Miles will be holding 2 information sessions about the programme at 7.30pm on Wednesday 7th November and 12.30pm on Thursday 8th November. Please book in advance as places are limited. Contact <mailto:bookings@bagnallcentre.com> or call [01494 791288](tel:01494791288) to reserve your place. 

The programme includes:

## A Personalised Diet

This will be based on a reduced calorie, reduced carbohydrate Mediterranean style diet, which will be tailored to your individual needs, considering your current health including diagnosed medical conditions and any additional symptoms such as digestive issues or fatigue, any medications, personal preferences and time constraints. 

**Please note:** IF you are taking one or more blood sugar lowering medications, you MUST discuss suitability of a reduced carbohydrate diet with your GP before starting this programme.   Medication does not exclude you from this programme but may require additional blood glucose monitoring or adjustments to medication* which will need to be discussed/managed by your GP.  If you choose not to discuss this with your GP, you do so as an independent choice.  

## Advice on Lifestyle

As part of the 8-week programme you will be provided with advice and support on key lifestyle factors associated with overall health:

**Sleep:** developing strategies for improving quality and duration of sleep.

**Stress management and relaxation:** identifying and addressing causes of stress and learning how to support relaxation through mindfulness and breathing exercises. 

**Activity levels:** helping you to find achievable ways of incorporating more regular physical activity into your week.  

## Weekly Appointments:

You will receive 8 regular weekly appointments to provide on-going advice and accountability, help with addressing any physical or emotional barriers to change and the encouragement to stay motivated.  These sessions can also be used to help you work through issues which may be contributing to stress such as poor work/life balance and low self-esteem or to help you work through other personal challenges.

As part of your appointments we will track progress using a Tanita Body Composition Analyser which measures total body weight, Body Mass Index (BMI), body fat, visceral fat, bone mass, muscle mass, physique rating, Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), metabolic age and hydration\*\*.

## Email support throughout the programme

If you have any queries about your programme or feel you need some additional motivation, Holly will be available to offer support via email between sessions.\*\**

\* The Bagnall Centre for Integrated Healthcare and Holly Miles Nutrition cannot give advice on medication.

\*\* Tanita body composition analysers are not suitable for anyone with an implanted medical device such as a pacemaker.  

\*\** Holly will aim to answer your emails within 24 hours.  If your query is more complex and requires further discussion it may be covered more fully in your next scheduled session.  For more urgent queries, there may be an option to bring your next appointment forward, or to arrange a telephone or Skype consultation with Holly, depending on circumstances.
