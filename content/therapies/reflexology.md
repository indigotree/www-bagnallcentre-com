Reflexology is based on the principle that there are reflex areas in the feet and hands, which are believed to correspond to parts of the body. It is a unique method, using the thumb and fingers, usually performed on the feet but in some cases also on the hands and ears. A practitioner will work the reflex areas, which may help to relieve stress and tension.

As with all treatments, a full consultation should be completed with your therapist to ensure that reflexology is right for you.
