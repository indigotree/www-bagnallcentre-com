Mindfulness Mindfulness is the psychological process of bringing one's attention to the internal and external experiences occurring in the present moment, which can be developed through the practice of meditation and other training.

This is applicable to society at large as well as specific settings such as workplacesand schools.Studies have also shown distress and worry contribute to mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety and that mindfulness -based interventions are effective in the reduction of both rumination and worry.
