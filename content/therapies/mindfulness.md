Mindfulness Mindfulness is the psychological process of bringing one's attention to the internal and external experiences occurring in the present moment, which can be developed through the practice of meditation and other training.

Large population-based research studies have indicated that the practice of mindfulness is strongly correlated with greater wellbeing and perceived health. This is applicable to society at large as well as specific settings such as workplaces and schools.Studies have also shown distress and worry contribute to mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety and that mindfulness-based interventions are effective in the reduction of both rumination and worry.
