Chiropractic is a complementary treatment that focuses primarily on the joints, and particularly the alignment of the spine, and a chiropractor will adjust and manipulate the alignment of the vertebrae using their hands. 

Chiropractic can be used to help relieve problems with the bones, muscles and joints and it is thought that this relieves pain and tension around the body by restoring the normal function of the central nervous system.
