Nutritional Therapy is relevant for individuals with chronic conditions as well as those looking for support to enhance their health and wellbeing. Nutritional Therapists aim to identify the underlying cause of an illness or imbalance rather than just treating the symptoms. By assessing medical and family history, symptoms, lifestyle and diet, practitioners are able to identify ways to correct nutritional balances that may be contributing to ill health. Every patient is considered to be unique and the practitioner develops a personalised nutrition and lifestyle programme to suit the individual.
