Here’s what Carly has to say about what she does and why she does it.<br/><br/></div>

“I discovered Dru Yoga in 2004 and fell in love with it. I had tried other styles of yoga, however, there was something a bit special with Dru Yoga that I hadn’t felt anywhere else. It gave me a beautiful sense of peace and stillness that stayed with me for long periods of time after a class. 

In 2013, after the birth of my second child, I began the Dru Yoga teacher training course. For me it has been a powerful and life changing experience and still continues as a journey through growth and change. 

I have expanded this journey by doing advanced courses, such as the Healthy Back programme and Continuing Professional Development (CPD) days with my masters. 

This year I have learnt Ayurvedic massage with one of the Dru Yoga senior tutors, who is also an Ayurvedic Practitioner and trainer. This took place in the main Dru centre in Snowdonia, Wales and has really helped to grow my business as a yoga teacher and reflexologist. 

I am now teaching four regular classes. Two in Rickmansworth at Loudwater Farm, one in St.Albans and now at this beautiful space in The Bagnall Centre. 

I also run quarterly Dru Yoga & Meditation days with my husband at Loudwater Farm and Eastcote House Gardens. Our next retreat is at Eastcote House Gardens from 10am-4pm on Sunday 1st July. I teach the yoga parts of the day and my husband teaches meditation. They are wonderful days where we see positive changes in our students. 

My passion and love for Dru Yoga grows every day, as I see how it is not only changing my life but those around me as well. Seeing my students grow and feel better is such a wonderful gift and privilege.”
