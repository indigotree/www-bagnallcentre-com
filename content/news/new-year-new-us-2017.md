It’s that time of year when we often make resolutions to improve our fitness, take up more exercise and after the excess of Christmas, focus on better nutrition. We’ve been busily planning our New Year and are looking forward to sharing our diverse new programme of activities to help you on your journey to better health.

We are here to help you make 2017 your healthiest happiest year ever - and the first of many healthy happy years to come! 

**Mental Health**

Mental health issues can have an impact on all aspects of our lives: holistic healthcare is all about ensuring that we look at the whole picture whilst recognising that every individual is different.

Mental health stigma in our society remains an ongoing issue but organisations like Time to Change are working hard to remove this barrier. Have a look at their campaign ‘time to talk day 2017’ which is coming up on 2nd Feb. You can find out more [here](https://www.time-to-change.org.uk/).

We passionately believe in the benefits of taking a holistic approach to healthcare. Most of us prioritise taking care of our physical wellbeing and appearance well above taking care of our emotional and mental health and wellbeing. Happily, an increasing volume of scientific research demonstrates that regular exercise, healthy nutrition and relaxation (taking a break from our permanent state of fight or flight) can all positively impact every aspect of our health and wellbeing.

Mindfulness is an integrative, mind-body based approach that can help people to manage and approach their thoughts and feelings differently. It is becoming increasingly widely used in a range of contexts and NICE recommend it as a preventative practice for people with experience of recurrent depression. Mindfulness and being self-aware can be an effective tool to help you respond differently to stress. 

Our broad range of cooking and nutrition activities, exercise and relaxation classes, counselling and other therapies can benefit and support mental health and wellbeing.

**The Bagnall Mindfulness Course**

This 5 week course is starting on Wednesday 15th February until Wednesday 15th March. Times are 7.30-8.45pm here at the Bagnall Centre.

The course is delivered by Julia Seymour, a Transformative Coach. It is designed to enable participants to become more present and mindful week-on-week and to embed their understanding into daily practice as the course progresses.

**New Programmes for 2017**

**Do you care about what you eat?**

**Do you care about your environment?**

**Do you care about future issues the next generation will face?**

Take a look at two of our inspiring new programmes for 2017 and find out more about issues that really matter.

**Family Health and Wellbeing Talks**

Respected wellbeing expert Brian Isbell, an experienced natural health practitioner and educator, will be holding weekly Bagnall Centre Family Health and Wellbeing talks on Monday mornings from 10am-12pm on 20th February to 27th March for £10 including refreshments (please book in advance to avoid disappointment!).

The talks are open to our clients and complementary health professionals who wish to broaden and deepen their knowledge of self-care and integrated healthcare.

The first talk will focus on family healthcare and how we can strengthen our health and wellbeing. It will also explore what holistic integrated healthcare really means; the role of nutrition, mental and emotional, genetic and family traits as well as the importance of environmental, social and spiritual aspects. It will also include a practical element demonstrating some simple self-help methods.

Full details of all the talks will be published on our website: they will include a huge range of health and wellbeing subjects including Water, Sleep, Sugar, Supplementation and The Body’s Bacteria.

These talks will help you and your family to understand and implement simple and effective health and wellbeing practices. For the benefit of complementary health practitioners, the talks qualify for Continuing Professional Development points and Brian will provide CPD certificates if required.

**Film Nights**

Our Director Joanna Hill, along with invited expert guest speakers, will be leading our new Film and Discussion Nights on the first Friday of every month, beginning on Friday 3rd February at 6.30pm. A charity donation of £10 including refreshments is suggested (please book in advance to avoid disappointment!). The first film - the feature-length documentary ‘Food Matters’ - is for those of you who are tired of the confusion surrounding food. In a collection of interviews with leading Nutritionists, Naturopaths, Scientists, Medical Doctors and Medical Journalists, ‘Food Matters’ informs you on the best food choices you can make for your family’s health, and discusses the impact that processed denatured food is having on human health.

Future films will cover a range of topics that impact different aspects of our lives and wellbeing such as food and farming, mental and emotional health, as well as a range of environmental, social and political issues. 

Through our Family Health and Wellbeing Talks and Film Nights programmes we would like to build a community of people to come together and learn through informed debate to what extent the lifestyle, cultural and environmental choices we make can impact our health and wellbeing - please come and join us.

Wishing you a happy and healthy 2017!
