The Bagnall Centre’s next conference ‘Lifestyle and Diabetes - how closely are they related?’ will take place on 8th June 2018 at Chartridge Lodge, Chesham, . 

The Conference aims to:

* raise awareness of the importance of lifestyle in diabetes prevention, management and reversal;
* demonstrate why an increasing number of medical professionals now recognise that a healthy lifestyle is a universally available and powerful anti-diabetes intervention;
* build awareness and understanding of the relationship between lifestyle and diabetes and how to reduce your risk.

Diabetes is one of the fastest growing threats to the health of the modern human. It is estimated that at least 1 in 16 people in the UK are potentially unknowingly living with, or in severe danger of developing, Type 2 diabetes. In fact, almost half of those affected are believed to be unaware of their condition!

With all of the complications that this life-changing condition can lead to; from nerve and ocular damage to potentially seizures and even death, it is more vital than ever for us to be aware of our own culpability in the prevalence of this growing epidemic.

Diabetes is, generally speaking, a blood sugar regulation problem. This means that either your pancreas is not producing enough insulin, or that your body is no longer properly recognising that which it is producing. Type 2 is the most common form of diabetes, and the one which you are at risk of developing if you have chronic high blood sugar. It is also more commonly lifestyle related - luckily this also means it is is the most treatable. 

Due to sustained high levels of sugar in the blood, your body is forced to continually produce larger and larger amounts of insulin, as you become effectively immune to your own hormones. Your body no longer appropriately responds to insulin released by the pancreas, leading to dangerously high blood sugar levels.

There are a number of common elements of our modern lifestyles which can exacerbate an existing predisposition to insulin problems, many of which are incredibly easy to mitigate with the right approach and knowledge,  as well as an awareness of your own power in taking control of your own health.

These are also choices that you can make starting right now, to easily implement change that which will have a significant impact on your health.

## Your Food Choices 

What many people don’t realise is the fact that our diet is the main factor affecting and controlling blood sugar, and that what we put in our mouths can dramatically increase our risk of diabetes. Without blood sugar problems caused by excessive refined sugars and carbohydrates in our diet, insulin release is far less likely become imbalanced or to function improperly, as our pancreas is not placed under such stress.

It is very easy to have a very significant effect on your intake of blood-sugar problem foods - choose wholegrain and natural foods, and eliminate added sugar from your diet. 

You can take simple steps such as swapping your morning slice of toast for a wholegrain and seeded, or perhaps try spelt, and replacing the sugar in your tea with stevia, a natural sweetener which has no impact on your insulin levels and is available in a granular form, much like sugar.

You can further reduce the pressure on your pancreas by limiting and ideally avoiding packaged and processed foods. Many of these have added sugars and hydrogenated fats, which have been shown to have a negative impact on metabolic functions. By making your own food from scratch, you can make sure that you know exactly what you are putting in your body.

## Reducing Your Stress

Stress is another thing which modern life seems custom-designed to send spiralling out of control, and it starts from a young age. Studies have actually shown that today’s secondary school students have similar levels of stress hormones as psychiatric patients in the 60’s. 

Cortisol, the major stress hormone, as well as several other hormones, cause glucose to be released into the blood stream. This process is designed to prepare us for a fight or flight response to danger, as it would give us the energy to react quickly to a threat. 

Unfortunately, our lives, now full of low level and pretty much constant anxiety, be it from worries at work or family strain, put us in a constant state of red alert.

Many people dismiss the new “fads” of meditation and mindfulness, but there is science to back up their effects on levels of anxiety and stress. A ten minute daily meditation session daily may seem bizarrely disconnected from your blood sugar, but it may in fact be key to reducing your risk of developing worryingly high-risk levels, and could even improve existing diabetes.

If you’re still not convinced that mindfulness is for you, look for other ways to reduce your stress. Walk the dog, take up a new hobby, or just turn off your smartphone when you get home from work; “unplugging” can help to decrease the stressors that you bring home from work. Even just finding five or ten minutes to simply do nothing can have a significant effect on your stress levels. 

## Remember To Exercise

There are many other lifestyle changes which have been shown to have an effect on blood sugar, such as exercise and supplementation, but reducing your sugar and processed foods have been shown to have the most significant impact. 

Research does also demonstrate the many benefits of regular exercise on all aspects of your overall health and it is important to try to make sure you find time for regular exercise. 

Lowering your sugar intake and reducing the amount of processed foods you eat are easy adjustments to make, and can have drastically reduce blood sugar problems. 

Start with these, and then decide if you need to make further changes, and remember that every positive change that you can make to improve your health is an investment in your body and your future.
