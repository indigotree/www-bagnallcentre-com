In our modern age we are surrounded by constant marketing - it’s easy to feel bombarded with images of perfect healthy lifestyles that feel unrealistic and unattainable.

It’s important to take a step back and identify what lifestyle changes we feel will make us happiest, and these don’t need to involve a full-scale transformation. 

Small, simple changes are more sustainable and can help you to feel positive about yourself. 

Here are five key areas where small tweaks can make a big difference – and they all start with ‘S’!

**1.** **Sleep**

Sleep is vital for good health, allowing our bodies and minds to rest, recuperate and prepare for the day ahead. Research shows that lack of sleep impacts on our mental and physical health, leaving us tired, unfocused and craving energy-dense foods. We all know that we are supposed to get seven to eight hours of undisturbed sleep each night but often life just gets in the way. 

There are a few simple steps you can take to improve the quality of your sleep, and it’s all down to good sleep hygiene. This involves developing certain simple habits around sleep; the key ones are sticking to a consistent bedtime, turning off electronic devices at least thirty minutes before bed, avoiding caffeinated drinks in the late afternoon and evening and developing a relaxing bedtime routine to help you unwind. 

**2. Stress**

Stress is the body’s response to danger; the heart rate increases and muscles tense in response to the release of stress hormones. Obviously, the ability to respond quickly to threats is no bad thing, but it can be unhelpful when this happens at the wrong time, and problems arise when we find ourselves continuously in a state of stress. Long-term stress can cause high blood pressure, fertility problems and insomnia and increases the risk of heart attack and type 2 diabetes – so reducing stress should be high on your list of priorities. 

One way to start to tackle stress is to limit your intake of caffeine, so why not pop a new herbal tea in your trolley next time you’re shopping.

Another key weapon against stress is physical activity – and the good news is low- and moderate-intensity exercise is just as good as a high-intensity workout. Simply getting out for a walk, a swim or a yoga class can help reduce stress. Even better if you factor activities like this in on a regular basis.

Simple relaxation techniques are also useful for dealing with stress - taking five minutes to sit quietly and focus on breathing deeply and calmly can help slow your heart rate and create a feeling of relaxation.  

**3. Sugar**

Sugar is added to all kinds of processed food to enhance flavour and keep us coming back for more. High-sugar foods can provide a brief energy boost but this is usually followed by a slump in energy levels, contributing to feelings of fatigue and low mood. The refined sugar added to processed foods causes fat build up around the liver and is a leading cause of obesity in children and adults. 

Research shows that sugar clearly isn’t doing us much good – so what are the simplest ways to cut down your consumption? 

We recommend replacing processed foods with whole foods. One idea is to swap processed breakfast cereals, which often contain high levels of sugar and very little fibre, for porridge topped with sliced fruit. Porridge doesn’t need to take ages in the morning either – check out this recipe for slow-cooked porridge that can be prepared the night before.

Or soaking porridge oats in whole fat yoghurt overnight makes a nourishing and filling breakfast (again, add some sliced fruit or seeds to boost the flavour and nutritional value).

If you are often tempted by sweet snacks, remember that whole fruits and unprocessed nuts can be a satisfying substitute that will help sustain your energy levels for longer. 

**4. Skin **

Did you know that your skin is your body’s largest organ, and the one that grows the fastest? It is our body’s protection from the outside world, makes vitamin D, helps to regulate our temperature and helps the body get rid of waste products and allergens, but all too often we take it for granted and don’t give it the care it deserves. Healthy skin can give you a radiant, glowing appearance, which in turn can boost your mood and make you feel good about yourself.

To boost skin health, keep hydrated by drinking water throughout the day and protect yourself from the sun – cover up with cool, loose clothing and use a gentle sunscreen.

Our diet also plays an important role in skin health so try to include sources of healthy fats such as salmon, mackerel, avocados and walnuts, as well as sweet potatoes, carrots and red peppers for beta-carotene, in addition to the all important green vegetables, raw salads and whole fruit. 

Your skin will naturally also benefit from better sleep, less stress and avoiding sugar. 

**5. Smoking **

This one doesn’t need much explaining! We all know smoking plays havoc with the skin and causes respiratory disease and cancer. Research suggests that most people who smoke want to quit, so clearly it doesn’t make us feel great about ourselves.

If you smoke, but want to stop, try making a written plan setting out a date when you will stop, and including a list of strategies for dealing with cravings when they happen. Your local NHS stop smoking service can offer advice and support and hypnotherapy can be very effective. 

Why not take some time to reflect on what changes you feel would make a positive difference in your life? At the Bagnall Centre we have therapists who can help you make positive lifestyle changes. Try focusing on one area that is important to you to begin with and consider what simple, sustainable changes you would like to make – and who knows where these changes could lead you!
