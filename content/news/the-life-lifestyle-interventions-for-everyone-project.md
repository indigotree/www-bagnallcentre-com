We are delighted to announce that we have already begun working on the pilot stage of the LIFE Project. 

The LIFE Project (Lifestyle Interventions For Everyone) has developed from Joanna’s passionate desire to inspire and help people to achieve positive lifestyle change to benefit their health and wellbeing.

The LIFE Project is testing the efficacy of an 8-week Nutrition and Lifestyle Change Programme. 

Holly Miles, Nutritional Therapist and Health Coach, whose dissertation on making change happen ‘Committed to Weight Loss: an IPA Analysis Into the Experiences of Individuals Who Lost Weight Through Nutritional Intervention’ was published in a peer reviewed journal, is currently working with 8 people on this programme.

The LIFE Project is also working with Kat Smith, an Endometriosis Specialist and Nutritional Therapist who focusses on female hormonal issues. 

We are excited that the measurable outcomes for all 8 participants are positive, including improved mood, lower blood sugar, weight loss and reduced pain. 

The LIFE Project programmes include bespoke nutritional therapy planning, lifestyle recommendations, educational resources to support progress and ongoing coaching support. 

We believe that coaching is key to the success of sustainable long-term positive nutrition and lifestyle change. As Holly comments “…from a client’s perspective, one of the biggest challenges for anyone who needs to make significant diet and lifestyle changes to support their health is actually sticking to the changes longer term. As a coach, you are able to help clients overcome their barriers to change such as learning to prioritise themselves, believing they are capable of achieving their goals or letting go of the all too common ‘all or nothing’ approach to life, which can be really counter-productive. Coaching can also be really beneficial for individuals suffering from stress.”

The LIFE Project programmes are aimed at both men and women and can help people with chronic health conditions such as Type 2 Diabetes, high blood pressure, fibromyalgia, excess weight, endometriosis, polycystic ovaries and other hormonal disruptions. They are also beneficial to pre-diabetics, and anyone interested in positively improving their health and wellbeing. 

If you are interested in finding out more about joining a programme please contact Joanna Hill directly at joanna@bagnallcentre.com or you can call The Bagnall Centre on 01494 791288 to arrange a confidential conversation with Joanna.
