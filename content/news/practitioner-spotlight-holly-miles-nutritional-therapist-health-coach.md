“I first discovered nutritional therapy about 5 years ago when nothing my GP could offer was making any difference to my often quite debilitating IBS, low mood and lack of energy.  Tests always came back as “normal” and none of the medications I was offered made a great deal of difference. Fortunately, I was lucky enough to have a GP who had heard of and understood the potential benefits of nutritional therapy, so he recommended I give it a try.   

I was so impressed by the benefits of nutritional therapy to my health that I decided to retrain and become a nutritional therapist myself.  I already had a degree in Physiology so chose to undertake an MSc in Personalised Nutrition alongside a Nutritional Therapy Practice Diploma.  Combined, these entitled me to register with the British Association of Nutrition and Lifestyle Medicine (BANT) and the Complementary and Natural Healthcare Council (CNHC).  It was a tough couple of years adjusting to having to study again having had a 20-year break from education plus having to juggle all of this with family life, but I felt so passionate about wanting to practice nutritional therapy and fascinated by the science which underpins its practice that I persevered.  I even managed to get my dissertation published in a peer reviewed journal; Committed to Weight Loss: an IPA Analysis Into the Experiences of Individuals Who Lost Weight Through Nutritional Intervention.

One of the things I appreciated most about the practice diploma was that this included two extensive modules on coaching and NLP (Neuro-Linguistic Programming).  The rationale behind this is that from a client’s perspective, one of the biggest challenges to anyone who needs to make significant diet and lifestyle changes to support their health, is actually sticking to the changes longer term.  As a coach you are able to help clients overcome their barriers to change such as learning to prioritise themselves, believing they are capable of achieving their goals or letting go of the all too common “all or nothing” approach to life, which can be really counterproductive.   Coaching and NLP can also be really beneficial for individuals suffering from stress, which is something I see in a lot of my clients. 

I currently offer the following services:

* Nutritional therapy - personalised nutrition and lifestyle programmes to support health and vitality and to help address symptoms such as indigestion, bloating and IBS, on-going fatigue, frequent infections, inability to lose weight, stress, anxiety and low mood, skin conditions and hormonal imbalances.
* A comprehensive dietary MOT - a one-off comprehensive dietary MOT which includes analysis of your existing diet to help identify nutritional imbalances and body composition analysis to measure useful markers such as visceral fat, muscle mass, bone mass, hydration and metabolic age.
* A 60-day personalised weight-loss programme which includes regular sessions to track progress, information on how your diet may be impacting on your current health including digestive symptoms, fatigue, hormones, low mood or stress.  Plus, on-going coaching support to help you overcome any barriers to change and to help you develop life-long healthy eating habits.
* Coaching sessions to help you find your motivation to change, break unhealthy eating habits, manage anxiety and stress and develop healthy habits.
