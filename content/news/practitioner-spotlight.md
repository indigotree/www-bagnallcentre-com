and why she does it.<br/><br/>

"When I started training 30 years ago everyone was into Jane Fonda aerobics. I happened to bump into a lady doing what I would later know as bicep curls: she showed me how to do them and from then I was hooked! It turned out that she was Russian and her husband was a powerlifter. During that time and for many years I would often be the only woman in the free weights area - this has all changed, which is a great thing. I’m a believer in not only using weights but also using our own body weight in training: this, if done properly, is effective in so many ways. 



Our bodies are an amazing bit of kit including the mind. I believe that in order to train effectively you also need to use the mind to train holistically. The gym and in turn exercise is the most effective antidepressant and often under-utilised in the treatment of mental health.  



There have always been two sides to me, the creative side and the exercise side. I worked in the arts, in administration, as well as vintage fashion, as a bass player and fashion historian, but during all this time I have always trained. Having suffered all my life with various chronic conditions and having had a number of operations, the gym was the thing that saved me mentally and physically. I decided I wanted to become a Personal Trainer so that I could help others create and achieve their goals to train for their own lives. To feel strong and be mentally resilient. 



I train my clients in all aspects of fitness. One of my crew, who is 21, has lost 5 stone, another ran his first 5k aged 69. Two ladies are training for a half marathon, another a triathalon and another learned to run again after fracturing her femur from her hip to knee.

<strong>‘Just Start!’</strong> and the rest will follow."
