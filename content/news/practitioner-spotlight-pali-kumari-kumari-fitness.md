Here's what Pali has to say about what she does, and why she does it.

**How my childhood has shaped me** 

I grew up in Kenya and went to school on the fringes of the Wildlife National Park. I remember my childhood as seemingly endless hours of playing outdoors barefoot with my brother and friends.

Sunday mornings often started with an invigorating 6am bike ride and finished with a wildlife drive through the national park or a picnic and a climb to the top of Mount Longonat. Not a Sunday went by where we weren’t exploring, seeking adventure and staying fit as a family. 

My parents have been my greatest inspiration. They taught me to be open minded and have adventure in my spirit. To never stop exploring, never stop learning.

They encouraged me to learn about and stay true to the Indian Culture. With their support I learned Indian Classical Dance from the age of 6 and as a 17 year old I went on to perform a solo 2 hour performance in front of 500 people as part of my Arengetram Ceremony.

**My journey to fitness and teaching**

At 14 my body presented me with Scoliosis, a curvature of the spine making it ‘S’ shaped rather than straight. I became increasingly crooked and suffered constant pain. Doctors wanted to put me in a brace; my mother refused and instead encouraged me to continue dancing, stretching and staying fit. It worked! I became stronger and largely pain free.

Having studied Environmental Science I became a campaigner at the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA), an organisation that investigates, and campaigns against, environmental crime.  I ran a project training local communities in Tanzania to use visual media to document environmental and human rights abuses to campaign for change. 

My work took me across South East Asia, Europe and into the depths of Tanzania. Daily exercise was vital for keeping me energised and focused. I carried workout DVDs with me everywhere, on occasions when we had no electricity in Africa, I’d train by the light of an oil lamp, looking out at the Milky Way in the middle of nowhere.

When I was young my father once bought me a Cosmopolitan magazine. I saw an article about a celebrity who had a personal trainer which resonated with me. Part of me ached to teach fitness but I was terrified of standing in front of a group of people to speak, let alone teach!

The project in Tanzania changed everything! It gave me the confidence that I could deliver skills to empower others. I decided that I wanted to help people find joy in movement and fitness in the way it had helped me - as something positive and enjoyable, not a chore or punishment.

The first steps towards this were qualifying as a Personal Trainer and subsequently as a Barre Instructor as I loved the grace of the Ballet. During that time I also tried many different Pilates classes to relieve the pain I was experiencing from the Scoliosis.

I was lucky enough to come across an amazing teacher who stripped Pilates back to basics, teaching me where to move from, how to find stability and length and move efficiently with freedom. For the first time in my life I am completely pain free. My back is strong. I stand taller and feel stronger. I have the deepest conviction in Pilates as a method to help alleviate back pain as well as prevent it. 

**My Pilates teaching**

My classes are taught with an emphasis on form and precision in movement. Commitment to mastering technique provides a solid foundation enabling my clients to move efficiently with power and grace. 

I love teaching but my real passion is watching my clients change for the better as they experience the benefits for body and mind. With dedication and patience I see my clients improve their posture and alignment, gain an increased awareness of their body, get stronger, fitter and achieve a better sense of wellbeing.

My Pilates classes take place in Chesham and Northwood and I have recently started to teach Pilates for Rehabilitation at a Physiotherapy Clinic in Ruislip. The majority of my referrals so far have been men and as a result, I have now launched a Pilates for Men class at the Bagnall Centre.

I believe that the secret to staying fit and supple is to have a varied regime combining strength, cardio and stretch. I therefore offer a holistic blend of classes including Pilates, Barre and TRX Suspension Training which was developed by the US Navy Seals to keep them fit and strong between missions.

Pali's Bagnall Centre Classes take place as follows: 

Monday 10:30-11.30am - Barre

Monday 7-8pm - Pilates

Monay 8-9pm - Pilates for Men

Tuesday 18:45-19:45pm - Pilates

Tuesday 19:50-20:50pm - TRX Suspension

Saturday 10:00-11am - Pilates
