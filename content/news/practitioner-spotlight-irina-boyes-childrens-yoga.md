We love working with our Practitioners!

Irina Boyes is teaching a new Children's Yoga course on Saturday mornings from 5th May-21st July. 

If you would like us to feature a spotlight on you and your work then please get in touch!
 
Here's what Irina has to say about what she does, and why she does it.
 
“When I was a child I liked walking on my hands around the living room, standing on my head, and walking upside-down like a crab arching my back.

What has stayed with me from those days is the delight I felt at the unusual things I could do with my body. Of course, back then I had no idea that most of these shapes were my own versions of classical yoga poses.

Before I discovered yoga, I had a long interest in education and holistic learning. I taught language and literature to children in Russia and the UK, and studied alternative approaches to education. What I discovered was that school children are usually treated as a head, shoulders, brain and a hand to write with; the rest of them remains hidden behind a desk and a curriculum. When I began to practise yoga I glimpsed a way to help children become body, mind and spirit at the same time.

I truly began to understand the potential of yoga for children when I embarked on a wonderful journey of becoming a Iyengar yoga teacher. Meanwhile I was trying to find some local yoga classes for my son who was at the time at primary school. Unfortunately none were available in my area so I thought " Why not me?" and decided to train as a Children's Yoga teacher myself. I have completed my training with Jo Jyoti Manuel, a pioneer in the field of yoga for children and the founder of Special Yoga. It was a fantastic experience and a big eye-opener too!

After my training I began teaching yoga in schools and after-school yoga clubs. Again and again I saw the delight of children discovering the infinite potential of their bodies. Once again, I noticed how the physical grounding of yoga poses helps to create stability in every other aspect of a child's wellbeing.

Yoga has given us the tools to help us live in harmony with ourselves and others. If children can learn to use these tools, and apply them to their own lives, then the world will be a brighter and more peaceful place..."
