September is traditionally time for ‘Back to School ‘and ‘Back to Work’ but we think it’s also time for Back to Fitness! Now it’s well and truly post-summer you’re probably back into your normal routine but it’s important to make sure you find time for exercise too.

The days are getting shorter and it can be tempting to cosy up at home as the evenings grow darker and colder. Many people suffer from Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) and exercising can help lift your spirits and boost your health. Autumn is a great time to focus on your fitness routine and increase your energy levels.

Carving out exercise time as part of your daily or weekly routine is key.

Here are our top tips to help you keep energised, stay on track and exercise your way through to Christmas!

**Find an exercise buddy!** If you commit to joining a new class or going for a regular run with someone else, it’s much harder to get out of and you can encourage each other to keep it up.

**Get outside!** Make some of your exercise outside in as natural an environment as possible. Maybe go for a run or even just a walk to boost your serotonin levels naturally.

**Schedule!** Work out when in your day you can fit in exercise, write it down, diarise it and stick to it!

**Nourish your body!** Cut out processed and artificial foods. Focus on soups and stews with whole foods and seasonal vegetables (squash, beetroot and carrots for example). This will help boost your energy levels.

**Sleep!** Most people need between 7 and 8 hours of decent sleep a night to function optimally. Cut out all electronic devices in the hour before you go to bed. Try to maintain a calm, decluttered environment in your bedroom with no computers or other electronics. This way your brain will learn to associate your bedroom with sleeping, not work.

If your body is feeling nourished through quality food and rested with proper sleep, you’re much more likely to stick to your exercise routine. Take a look at our Studio & Gym classes diary [here](/fitness-and-exercise/) and see if there’s something you might like to try.

Good luck and we’d love to hear your top tips on making exercise a regular part of your life.
