We are delighted that we are currently expanding the range of yoga classes we offer at The Bagnall Centre. 

Yoga can improve your health and wellbeing in so many ways. The benefits are far-ranging and it is accessible to everyone - you can enjoy yoga at any age and any level. It is not competitive, and a good teacher will help and enable everyone in their class to work to a level they are comfortable with individually.  

## What are the benefits of Yoga

Increasing scientific evidence is demonstrating the positive impact yoga can have on health and wellbeing. For example, NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) guidelines for treating lower back pain now include yoga as one of the first steps to be taken in managing the condition.

Here are just a few of our favourite health benefits that can be gained from regular and consistent yoga practice.

* Improves flexibility, balance and posture
* Improves the health of muscles, bones and internal organs
* Can help with chronic pain
* Can help lower blood pressure and boost your immune system
* Releases endorphins that improve your mood
* Helps you relieve stress, focus and be mindful of the present moment

## Which type of Yoga should I choose?

Yoga is thought to have originated in India between 5 and 10,000 years ago and has developed into many different schools and styles. 

Yoga is increasing in popularity in the Western world, as people recognise its potential to develop flexibility and strength, improve overall fitness and relieve stress. As well as many traditional styles of yoga, there are all sorts of ‘trendy’ styles of yoga springing up - amongst many and crazier others, you can practice ‘Rooftop Yoga’ on top of The Shard in London, enjoy Yoga with Dogs (sometimes called ‘Doga’) or enjoy various forms of Hot Yoga, guaranteed to make you sweat. 

If not all yoga is the same, how do you know which one is right for you?

We don’t offer Rooftop, Dog or Hot Yoga but we have put together a guide to some of the different types of yoga classes we do run. Take your pick! 

## Dru Yoga

Dru Yoga is rooted in Hatha yoga and is a strong, energising form of yoga with a focus on classical yoga postures (asanas), breath work (pranayama) and flowing sequences. Dru Yoga with Carly is a class for mixed ability. With its foundations set firmly in yogic tradition and its emphasis on soft, flowing movements, Dru Yoga can help increase energy levels, ease back pain and wash away stress. 

## Hatha Yoga

Hatha Yoga is a generic term referring to yoga that teaches you physical postures. In most Hatha Yoga classes, you can expect a gentle introduction to a range of basic yoga postures. Our Hatha Yoga class with Halina emphasises movement, alignment and rhythm and requires appropriate effort. Halina describes it as releasing, exhilarating and energising.

## Mother and Baby Yoga

These postnatal classes are an opportunity to help ease your way back into exercise after giving birth. Gentle yoga for you and your baby can help you stretch and tone your body. Our mixed ability class with Barbara welcomes complete beginners or experienced yogis and is suited to different energy levels in your new role as Mum. Suitable for Mums with babies from eight weeks to crawling. 

## Sivananda Yoga

This takes a classical and holistic approach to Hatha yoga and is reputed to be one of the first yoga styles to become popular in the West. This yoga system combines pranayama (breathing), asana (posture), and relaxation to build strength, flexibility and a deep meditative practice.  

## Vini Yoga

Vini means adaptation in Sanskrit so it follows that Vini Yoga is about adapting traditional yoga practices to fit the individual’s needs, limits and goals. We offer both mixed ability and intermediate classes with Barbara. These Vini Yoga classes use combined breath and movement in postures to stretch out the body and focus the mind. Active classes, with some posture adaptation for individual needs. 

## Vinyasa Yoga 

Vinyasa yoga, adapted from the traditional ashtanga system, can be athletic and active. We run a Dynamic Vinyasa Flow yoga class with Hazel - a gentle Vinyasa style class with an emphasis on alignment, form and safety. Options and modifications of the poses will be offered to enable you to adjust the class to your own level of practice regardless of flexibility or fitness level. 

## Yin Yoga

This slow, simple yoga practice can be very beneficial if you are looking to calm your mind and stretch your body. Our Yin Yoga and Meditation class with Halina emphasises stillness, core softness and surrender. Long, deep, passive holds, preparing your body and mind for meditation. 

Get in touch and try one of our yoga classes and boost your health and wellbeing. 

Your lifestyle. Your health. Your choices.
