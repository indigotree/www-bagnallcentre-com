**We love working with our Practitioners!**

**If you would like us to feature a spotlight on you and your work then please get in touch!**

**Here's what Robert has to say about what he does, and why he does it.**

I’m the founder and Chief Instructor at Bodimprove. I have been training in Martial Arts since the age of 12, that’s 23 years now. At the age of 16, I met 'Sifu Sławomir Pawłowski' and with him, I started training in the 'Shaolin Luohan Quan' Style and many other styles of the Shaolin Martial Order. 

It was also 'Sifu Sławomir' who first introduced me to Qi Gong & Taiji. Under his supervision, I studied the Qi Gong systems of Shaolin Ba Duan Jin, Shaolin Yi Jin Jing, introductory exercises to the Xi Sui Jing system, Shi Er Da Jin Gong and the Shaolin system Luohan Zhuang Kung as well as Taiji '24 Yang' Style.

In 2016, I made my first visit to Llandudno where I studied Guo Lin Qi Gong under the supervision of Dr Xie. I visited Dr Xie on several occasions, perfecting my style of teaching and in 2017, I had the great honour to become his 'Tudi' (Apprentice) and train continuously with him, every day, for over six months.

In that time I learnt the following Medical Qigong systems:

* Five Animal Frolics
* The Six Syllable Formula
* Muscle/Tendon Changing Classic
* Five Elements Palm
* Health Preserving Qigong
* Internal Nourishing Qigong
* Shaolin One Finger Meditation Qigong.

Under Dr Xie, I also studied the theories and clinical applications of Medical Qi Gong.

**What is Qi Gong?**

Qi Gong is the best kept stay young, stay healthy, stay happy, energy secret in the world today. It is the art of deliberately managing your ‘vital’ energy to help you live a happier, healthier and longer life.

Vital energy (Qi or Chi) is the life force that keeps us all alive. Qigong practitioners are literally adding years to their lives and life to their years through the simple, direct and efficient art of Qigong.

**My Qi Gong Classes**

**Meditation Qi Gong** (Shaolin Luohan Shi Ba Shou) movements stimulate faster blood circulation, develop muscles, strengthen bones, increase tendon elasticity, improve oxygenation of the body and generate Chi energy flow through reservoirs and meridians, acting favourably on all organs.

Systematic practice leads to increased flexibility of the cervical spine, improved overall flexibility of the body, high level of physical balance, bringing relief to people suffering from chronic headaches, stiff neck and spine and stomach problems. Muscle development occurs as a result of the slow process of strengthening the body without overloading, which can often cause injury. 

**Qi Gong For Life** - Qigong practice reduces hypertension, eliminates stress, and restores optimal function of internal organs. Qigong strengthens hands and their manual efficiency.

Calmness and relaxation during exercises affect the whole body, improving functions of the digestive, circulatory, nervous and immune systems, removing harmful pathogens from the body and immunising the body against external pathogens.

**Robert runs Meditation & Qi Gong, Qi Gong for Life and Meditation Qi Gong classes at The Bagnall Centre.**

**Classes start in the first week of October.**
