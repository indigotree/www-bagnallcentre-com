We love working with our Practitioners!

If you would like us to feature a spotlight on you and your work then please get in touch!

Here's what Helena has to say about what she does, and why she does it.

**Who am I?**

I am originally from Sweden but have spent all my adult life in the UK.  I currently live in a small village just outside Chesham together with my husband and two young boys.

I love herbal teas, so you will often see me enter the Bagnall Centre with a travel mug in hand containing my favourite tea (currently raspberry and cranberry!). 

I teach Pilates and self-massage techniques (focusing on fascia release) to enable people to take control of their own wellbeing and become free from niggling back or neck pain. 

My ultimate aim is to educate and empower people to manage their own wellbeing long term through practicing self-care. I help my clients to get back to feeling stronger, more balanced and enjoying an active life again without pain.

**My story**

I used to have terrible neck and back pain caused by sitting hunched over a computer all day. 

Over a period of 10 years I visited several specialists including Neurologists, Chiropractors, Acupuncturists and Physiotherapists. I tried Alexander Technique and Yoga. Sadly, nothing seemed to have a lasting effect. 

I had started to lose hope when a Physiotherapist recommended I attend Pilates classes. After a few weeks of classes the pain started to ease off.  I could sit for longer, enjoy going out for a meal again and get back to playing tennis in my spare time! 

I had previously thought that a few weeks with a specialist would solve my problems. It was now evident that I needed to set some time aside, on a regular basis, to put some work in myself. I needed to work on strengthening my supporting muscles and release built-up tension caused by years of sitting in front of a computer in an office.  

After having my second child I made the decision to leave my office-based job and start teaching Pilates and self-massage techniques in a quest to help others become free from pain, in the same way I had managed to.  

**What can you expect from my sessions?**

My Pilates classes and private sessions focus on precision and form,  targeting the supporting core muscles as well as keeping you safe and free from undue tension, making them ideal for those with niggling pain. My clients often mention that they leave feeling calm and strong. They enjoy a good full body workout but feel stretched too. 

I am also trained in the latest fascia release techniques and teach simple but effective self-massage techniques in workshops and private sessions using small balls and soft foam rollers. People enjoy the gentle but effective massage and love feeling the difference it makes in their body after only one session.
