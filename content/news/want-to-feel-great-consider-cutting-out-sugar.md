**Want to feel great? Consider cutting out sugar**

Recently there has been a shift in focus away from fat and towards sugar as the leading culprit in the battle against a rising tide of health problems caused by poor diet and sedentary lifestyles.

We are realising that this seemingly innocuous white powder is causing addiction and impacting on our mood, wellbeing and health.

Let's take a closer look at the problems with sugar and the health benefits of quitting the white stuff.

There are several types of sugar, which arise naturally in a range of foods and are also added to foods during processing. Our bodies require sugar, which is released into the bloodstream in the form of glucose, for energy.

However, it's important to realise that our bodies are able to make the glucose we need from carbohydrates, protein and fat. The problems arise when we take on too much sugar too quickly, especially in the form of added sugar in processed foods. These so-called ‘free sugars’, particularly in the form of glucose and fructose, are very quickly absorbed and cause blood sugar levels to spike before rapidly reducing.

**Why is this a problem?**

The sudden energy boost we get from foods high in added sugar is quickly followed by a slump as insulin is rapidly released to bring glucose levels down. This energy-level rollercoaster can have a dramatic impact on mood and wellbeing, which can contribute to increased levels of stress and anxiety.

Studies have also suggested a possible link between sugar and negative effects on learning and memory, as well as the body’s ability to cope with stress due to sugar’s disruptive effect on the hormonal balance. Sugar can also impact on sleep as the body struggles to maintain consistent energy levels.

Moreover, excess sugar that is not required for energy gets stored in the body as fat. Obesity is a significant health issue with sixty-two percent of British adults classed as overweight or obese, but excess fat is not always so obvious. Fat can also be stored around the internal organs – this is known as visceral fat. Too much fat stored in the body can lead to insulin resistance, which is linked to type 2 diabetes and heart disease.

Studies also suggest that a diet high in refined carbohydrates and added sugars increases the risk of inflammation in the body. Inflammation is a key factor in the development of serious health conditions such as cardiovascular disease, autoimmune conditions and cancer.

**Cutting down and cutting out**

Too much sugar is causing a wide range of health problems, and cutting out added sugar in your diet has clear benefits for your health and wellbeing.

A key strategy to reduce sugar is to cut out or minimise consumption of processed foods as these often contain very high levels of sugar, even in supposedly ‘healthy’ options such as fruit flavoured yoghurt (particularly the low-fat varieties).

High levels of added sugar also lurk in unexpected places such as bread, cereal and ready-made sauces - the added sugar in some ready-made tomato sauces can account for more than one third of an adult’s daily recommended sugar intake.

Once processed foods are out, you are left with a great range of nutritious, whole foods, fruits and vegetables, which you can enjoy knowing that you are providing your body with a source of slow-release, balanced energy with all the fibre, vitamins and minerals that nature intended.

For carbohydrates, brown rice, wholegrain bread and wholemeal pasta are better choices than refined, white versions, because the carbohydrate is processed into glucose more slowly in the body. As an added bonus, unrefined foods also contain beneficial fibre and retain their naturally occurring nutrients.

Although fruit is naturally sweet because of its sugar content, the effect of this on the body is balanced by the fibre and pulp that is also eaten, meaning that the sugar is absorbed more slowly and doesn’t cause blood glucose levels to spike.

On the other hand, a glass of fruit juice can contain all the sugar from several fruit, but none of the helpful fibrous bulk. A better choice is a smoothie, freshly made with a range of whole vegetables and fruit; aim for at least a third green vegetables and try adding carrot, beetroot, banana or avocado for a naturally tasty sweet flavour.

Finally, when cutting down on sugar or cutting it out altogether, it’s easy to overlook the role of alcohol. Many alcoholic drinks and mixers contain high levels of added sugar, and excess alcohol makes it difficult for the liver to regulate blood sugar effectively, so to minimise sugar intake it’s best to stick to one or two drinks and choose beer, dry wine or spirits mixed with soda water.

After cutting out sugar for a sustained period, people report a wide range of benefits including:

\* improved sleep,

\* better mood,

\* reduced stress,

\* weight loss,

\* increased energy levels

\* and even younger-looking skin!

We have many success stories of clients who have found their health has benefitted from giving up sugar. Read what one of our clients has to say.

"With the help of hypnotherapy I gave up sugar 10 weeks ago, a habit that I'd had for 38 years. I am amazed and still incredulous that I have managed to stop. And there are so many benefits!

I know I'm not putting something into my body that may well make me sick later - my family has a history of diabetes. Stubborn fat has definitely decreased and my skin looks better. Even my teeth seem healthier, they don't feel as if they are coated in sugar. And I am no longer struggling with the classic mid-afternoon slump.

Perhaps a surprising benefit for me is I have been motivated to start cutting out hidden and added sugars in the rest of my diet."

Cutting out sugar needn’t be a chore or a sacrifice; instead it can be a way to discover new ways to prepare delicious food and improve your health and wellbeing, helping to set yourself on a path to a balanced, positive and healthy lifestyle.
