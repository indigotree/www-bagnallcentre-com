Our first Bagnall Centre for Integrated Healthcare Conference took place on Friday 10th November 2017 at Chartridge Lodge, Chesham, Bucks HP5 2TU, in collaboration with the <a href="https://collegeofmedicine.org.uk/" target="_blank">College of Medicine and Integrated Health</a>. 

The charity Cancer Research UK states that 1 in 2 people in the UK will develop cancer at some point in their lives. Every year, more than 350,000 people are diagnosed with the disease. But experts estimate that more than 4 in 10 cancer cases could be prevented, largely through lifestyle changes.

The aim of our Conference was to: 

* raise awareness of the importance of lifestyle in cancer prevention and management;
* demonstrate why an increasing number of medical professionals now recognise that a healthy lifestyle is a universally available and powerful anti-cancer intervention;
* build awareness and understanding of the relationship between lifestyle and cancer and how to reduce your risk.
