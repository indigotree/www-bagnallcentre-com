 The BASI (Body Arts and Science international) approach to Pilates provides a contemporary approach to the repertoire whilst also staying true to the original Pilates method. Our classes aim to provide a well rounded, challenging workout, strengthening abdominals, back extensors, glutes, shoulders. You will leave the class feeling engaged and mobilised.
