Shaolin Luohan Shi Ba Shou (Qi Gong for Strength*) movements stimulate faster blood circulation, develop muscles, strengthen bones, increase tendon elasticity, improve oxygenation of the body, and generate Chi energy flow through reservoirs and meridians, acting favourably on all organs. 

 Qi Gong for Strength* - a block runs for 8 weeks and includes 2 classes a week.
