Shaolin Luohan Shi Ba Shou (Meditation Qi Gong*) movements stimulate faster blood circulation, develop muscles, strengthen bones, increase tendon elasticity, improve oxygenation of the body, and generate Chi energy flow through reservoirs and meridians, acting favourably on all organs. 

 Meditation Qi Gong* - a block runs for 8 weeks and includes 2 classes a week.
