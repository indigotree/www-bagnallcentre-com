Pali’s Pilates classes enable you to understand how to get more from your own body; to be able to move more freely with strength, improved flexibility and increased postural awareness. With a strong emphasis on form and technique that challenges the body and mind, each class will leave you feeling invigorated with a sense of wellbeing and accomplishment.
