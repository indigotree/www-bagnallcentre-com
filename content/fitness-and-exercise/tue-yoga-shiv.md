Yoga with Shiv examines yoga poses using physics, anatomy, physiology and neural science. Traditional yoga poses require the mind to survey various elements of a pose together, but instead, by fully concentrating on just one aspect, we can be closer to the ideal of yoga – stilling the mind. The relationship between muscles and the brain is just one of the totally new concepts examined in the Yoga practice.
