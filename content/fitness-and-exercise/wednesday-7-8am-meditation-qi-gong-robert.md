Qigong is an ancient Chinese method to strengthen life energy (Qi). It makes you feel stronger, and more relaxed. There are studies suggesting that regular practice reduces stress, improves health, and enhances quality of life.

This Morning Qigong is for you if you're ready to wake up everyday before the sunrise and come to the Bagnall Centre to practice Qigong exercises for an hour to increase your energy and help you deal with stress during the day.
