# Room Booking Times

<div class="orangeline"></div>

It's important all room users choose the appropriate booking period to avoid conflicts and to be respectful of other practitioners. The centre also expects rooms to be available for use even if the booking system shows them as unoccupied.

**30 minutes**

This is the minimum booking period for a room. Choose this booking for brief consultations or sessions that require no set up or clearing down.

**60 minutes**

This is the most common booking for ad hoc use. Choose this booking if you provide treatments or services up to a maximum of 50 minutes and require little set up and clear down.

**90 minutes**

This booking provides sufficient time for practitioners who choose to offer a 'clinical' hour and require more time for room set up and clear down or post treatment consultation.
